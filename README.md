# 🏡 ALX Listing App

## About the Project

The **ALX Listing App** is a modern web application project that lays the foundation for building an **Airbnb clone**. This milestone focuses on setting up a **scalable, production-ready Next.js application** using **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**.

The goal is to create a **dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page** while adhering to best practices in project structure, reusability, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

By completing this milestone, developers will:

* Gain hands-on experience scaffolding a **Next.js 13+** project for production readiness.
* Use **TypeScript** for type safety and code consistency.
* Implement **TailwindCSS** for responsive and accessible UI components.
* Structure the app using **industry-standard practices** for scalability and readability.
* Create foundational reusable components for real-world applications.

## 🧱 Project Structure

The project follows a clean and organized folder structure to ensure scalability and maintainability.

```
alx-listing-app/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Card)
├── interfaces/       # TypeScript interfaces and prop definitions
├── constants/        # Static data and configuration values
├── public/
│   └── assets/       # Images, icons, and other static resources
├── styles/           # Global styles (Tailwind configuration and CSS)
├── pages/            # Next.js pages and routing
├── package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tailwind.config.js# TailwindCSS configuration
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

### Folder Overview

* **components/** — Contains reusable UI components such as cards, buttons, and other elements used across the app.
* **interfaces/** — Stores TypeScript interface definitions (`CardProps`, `ButtonProps`, etc.) to ensure type safety.
* **constants/** — Holds fixed values or configurations (e.g., API URLs, theme settings).
* **public/assets/** — Contains all static assets like images and SVGs for the listing page.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Next.js 13+** — Framework for React-based web apps with server-side rendering and routing.
* **TypeScript** — Adds static typing and improves code reliability.
* **TailwindCSS** — Utility-first CSS framework for responsive, modern UIs.
* **ESLint** — Ensures clean, consistent, and error-free code.
